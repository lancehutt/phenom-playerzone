# phenom-playerzone
A simple playerzone script

### THIS SCRIPT IS PROVIDED AS IS AND NO SUPPORT WILL BE PROVIDED
Ever want to limit the playzone in your city? Maybe keep players in a zone for school RP or for a city purge event. This is a simple script to keep players inside a zone. If they leave the zone, they will be teleported back to the center of the zone.

Resmon is 0.00 idle and 0.01 when out of zone check is performed. (Player check is set for every 10 second but you can change it.)

### Installation
Place phenom-playerzone-main in your resources

Remove the (-main) from the folder name

Set your center coords and radius in the playerzone.lua

Ensure #phenom-playerzone in server.cfg

Restart server (Remember....all player will get teleported to the center of the zone regardless of where they are)
